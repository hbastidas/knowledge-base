# Thomas's Knowledge Base #

Here I store all the knowledge I want to keep track of.

## Topics ##

Currently it's only about computer stuff. System administration, software development, hardware,...

Maybe one day I will talk about other topics, who know.

I try to keep the content in English only, but there may be exceptions.

## History ##

Until now, I stored my knowledge into :

- Technical posts into my blog (since 2008)
- Text files into my private SVN repository (since 2005)

Today (2012), I want to use a more convenient and open place.
Features are :

- Open Source, because knowledge should be shared
- Open Source, because I will be forced to keep the content well organized
- Markdown text formatting, for the simplicity and accessibility of ASCII text
- Versioned under Git, because today it's the SCM I use for everything

Of course, there will be a long transition, but there is no emergency !

## Later ##

One day, I will also publish this content on my website with a nice CSS, probably under http://kb.tmartin.fr, maybe with a commenting system.

However, the best place to store documentation and knowledge is probably
the upstream documentation of the related project, but it's a lot more work...
And usually I write quickly into my knowledge base while working on a urgent
project !
