_When deploying and administering systems infrastructures it is still common to think in terms of individual machines rather than view an entire infrastructure as a combined whole. This standard practice creates many problems, including labor-intensive administration, high cost of ownership, and limited generally available knowledge or code usable for administering large infrastructures. The model we describe treats an infrastructure as a single large distributed virtual machine. We found that this model allowed us to approach the problems of large infrastructures more effectively._
